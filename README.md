Simplifies audio tagging using a metadata markup format and a Wizard to aid in creating the format.

## What does it do?

- Organize multiple albums and tracks in a single configuration file
- Batch re-encode audio files (WAV, FLAC, MP3, etc.) with consistent quality settings
- Automatically apply metadata tags (title, artist, album, track number, year, genre, copyright)
- Maintain a structured workflow for audio mastering projects

## Download

- **Windows**: Pre-built 64-bit installers (MSI and EXE) available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/DanielLMcGuire/Mastering_Utility/releases/latest)
- **Linux/macOS**: Download artifacts from the latest [GitHub Actions build](https://github.com/DanielLMcGuire/Mastering_Utility/actions)
- **Build from source**: See instructions below

## Prerequisites

### Required
- **ffmpeg** - Must be installed and available in your system PATH
  - Test with: `ffmpeg -version`
  - Download from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

### For building from source
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- 64-bit system (Recommended)

## Installation

### Option 1: Use pre-built binaries
Download the appropriate installer for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/DanielLMcGuire/Mastering_Utility/releases).

### Option 2: Build from source

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/DanielLMcGuire/Mastering_Utility.git
cd Mastering_Utility

cmake -S . -B build
# Optional: use Ninja for faster compilation
# cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja

cmake --build build
```

## Usage

The utility consists of two tools:

### 1. Mastering Wizard (`masteringwizard`)
Interactive tool to create INI configuration files.

```bash
# Create a new configuration file
./masteringwizard output.ini

# Show help
./masteringwizard --help
```

The wizard will prompt you for:
- Number of albums
- Album metadata (title, artist, genre, year, copyright, album art path)
- Output directory for processed files
- Song information (source file, title, artist, track number, output filename)
- Audio codec settings (libmp3lame, flac, copy, etc.)

**Tip**: You can type `exit` or `quit` at any prompt to exit the wizard.

### 2. Mastering Utility (`masteringutility`)
Processes the INI file and encodes all tracks.

```bash
# Process an INI configuration file
./masteringutility myalbum.ini
```

This will:
- Read album and song metadata from the INI file
- Create output directories as specified
- Re-encode each track with ffmpeg using your chosen codec
- Apply all metadata tags to the output files
- Retry failed conversions up to 3 times

## INI File Format

The INI file uses a simple custom format:

```ini
album 1 ("Album Title", "Artist Name", "Â© 2025 Copyright", "cover.jpg", "./source", "./output", "Genre", "2025", "Optional comment")
{
    song 1 ("Track Title", "Artist Name", 1, "input.wav", "01-track.mp3", "libmp3lame", "Genre", "2025", "Optional comment")
    song 2 ("Another Track", "Artist Name", 2, "input2.flac", "02-track.flac", "flac", "Genre", "2025")
}

album 2 ("Second Album", "Different Artist", "N/A", "art.jpg", "./", "./album2", "Rock", "2024")
{
    song 1 ("Song One", "Different Artist", 1, "song1.wav", "song1.mp3", "libmp3lame", "Rock", "2024")
}
```

### Album syntax
```
album <ID> ("Title", "Artist", "Copyright", "AlbumArtPath", "SourcePath", "OutputPath", "Genre", "Year", "Comment")
```

### Song syntax
```
song <ID> ("Title", "Artist", TrackNumber, "SourceFile", "OutputFile", "Codec", "Genre", "Year", "Comment")
```

### Supported codecs
Any ffmpeg audio codec, including:
- `libmp3lame` - MP3 encoding (VBR quality 3 by default)
- `flac` - FLAC lossless encoding (compression level 12 by default)
- `aac` - AAC encoding
- `libopus` - Opus encoding
- `copy` - Copy audio stream without re-encoding (The wizard will default to this)

## Example Workflow

```bash
./masteringwizard myproject.ini
```
