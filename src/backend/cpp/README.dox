 * @page MasteringUtilityCXXPage Mastering Utility C++ Library Overview
 *
 * @section intro_sec Overview
 * The Mastering Utility provides a simple workflow for batch mastering audio
 * using ffmpeg. It reads album and song metadata from a custom markup file,
 * processes each track, embeds metadata and album art, and writes output files
 * into the specified directories. A caching system prevents unnecessary
 * reencoding when source files or markup have not changed.
 *
 * @section markup_sec Markup Format
 * The markup file defines albums and their songs using a lightweight syntax:
 *
 * @code
 * album 1 ( "Album Name", "Artist", "Copyright",
 *           "cover.jpg", "./", "./new", "Genre", "2025", "Comment" )
 * {
 *     song 1 ( "Song Title", "Artist", 1,
 *              "input.wav", "output.mp3", "libmp3lame",
 *              "Genre", "2025", "Track comment" )
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Each album block contains one or more songs. All fields may be quoted and
 * whitespace is automatically trimmed.
 *
 * @section features_sec Features
 * - Parses album and song metadata from the custom markup format  
 * - Validates audio codecs by querying ffmpeg  
 * - Applies metadata tags (title, artist, album, genre, year, copyright, etc)  
 * - Embeds album art when supported by the chosen codec  
 * - Handles optional custom ffmpeg arguments per album or song  
 * - Uses a hash based cache to skip reprocessing unchanged files  
 * - Writes updated markup files back to disk  
 *
 * @section processing_sec Processing Workflow
 * The typical workflow is:
 * 1. Load the markup file  
 * 2. Parse albums and songs  
 * 3. For each album:  
 *      - Create output directories  
 *      - Copy album art when needed  
 *      - Compare file hashes with the cache  
 * 4. For each song:  
 *      - Validate codec  
 *      - Construct an ffmpeg command  
 *      - Apply metadata and album art  
 *      - Execute encoding  
 * 5. Save updated caches
 *
 * @section cache_sec Caching System
 * Each album stores a small cache file in:
 * @code
 * <NewPath>/.mas/<AlbumID>.masc
 * @endcode
 *
 * The cache tracks:
 * - A hash of the markup file  
 * - A list of songs and their input file hashes  
 *
 * If the markup or input file changes, the song is reencoded. Otherwise, it is skipped.
 *
 * @section requirements_sec Requirements
 * - ffmpeg must be installed and available in PATH  
 * - The markup format must be syntactically valid  
 * - Codec names must be supported by ffmpeg  
 *
 * @section usage_sec Usage Summary
 * - Provide a markup file describing albums and songs  
 * - Run the utility to process all audio  
 * - Modify metadata and regenerate the markup as needed  
 * - Rerun the tool to pick up changes; unchanged files are skipped automatically  
 *
 * @section example_sec Minimal Example
 * @code{.cpp}
 * MasteringUtility util;
 * util.Master("album.mas");
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section notes_sec Notes
 * - Additional ffmpeg arguments are sanitized to prevent injection  
 * - Album level arguments apply to all songs unless overridden  
 * - Song level arguments override album arguments
